1. The loaction page is something that really stood out to me. It definitley seemed like a complicted feature but came out looking really well. the way all the information was presented was very clear and clean. There are a lot of navigation links from the home page that give important unformation about each food truck.

2. I think Chad's website definitley has better user experience than mine. that definetley comes in the difference between presentation of information. The quality of pictures a long with the amount of consice information really makes a big difference. His files are much more organized, especially the images folder.

3. The code itself is equally as maintainable as mine although the CSS files are a little more spread out and well defines than mine. Like I said in number two the images folder was way more organized than mine.

4. I think the elements choosen were appropriate and did well as descriptors and probably helped with the organization of the code. This probably played a big part in keeping track of certain code and their respective CSS files. I think the CSS is well organized as well because of the fact that there are CSS files for specific things and are named accordingly.

5. Honestly I dont have much else to say. This looks like a really well done professional website. The information along with the presentation and ease of navigation all play a part in making this a great website.
