  <p>How I believe I have met the criteria...</p>
  <ol>
    <li>I have created this website thinking of others that may be interested in food trucks that are in Harrisonburg because there aren't many sites out there that provide a list of the best.</li>
    <li>I created all of the layouts and page structure in my own thinking. The menu items and specific food truck details/images were obtained from other websites to let the viewer know more about each food truck.</li>
    <li>My site has a Home, Menus, Locations, Details, and Feedback page, each providing the viewer with new and unique information.</li>
    <li>My header for my Home page is a banner of a food truck as well as text in the upper right hand corner on non-mobile devices</li>
    <li>The nav links are at the top!</li>
    <li>My website works great for phones, tablets, and monitors of different sizes! It restructures the columns based off of the media query width.</li>
    <li>Repeated rules are in styles.css and animations.css, all other css files are unique in there own way</li>
    <li>All of my images contain alt atrributes to briefly explain what the image represents</li>
    <li>Each page relevant to my website has a favicon!</li>
    <li>Each file is in a directory relevant to its extension/purpose other than index.html and report.html</li>
    <li>I use no built in frameworks or libraries! I don't think it counts but I use Google Icons for some of my icons.</li>
    <li>My pages/stylesheets adhere to Nu Validator.</li>
    <li>I tend to favor left-alignment except for when the viewer is on smaller devices, then I use centering.</li>
    <li>No text bleeds into or outside of its edges when adjusting the screen.</li>
    <li>I use sans-serif font for titles and the default font for all other text.</li>
    <li>I have a form, although it is non-functional, in feedback.html.</li>
    <li>I link to food truck/yelp websites on my home page and to the flavors for scotty's on the menus page.</li>
    <li>I believe my code is readable, and it uses conventional and consistent formatting for classes and IDs.</li>
    <li>Each page has a fade-in animation for each card on the page, source code is in animations.css</li>
    <li>My website is stores on GitHub. It is private but I sent a collab link to to Dr. Stewart since it has an api key in there for google maps.</li>
    <li>All files are lowercase and contain only alphanumeric characters.</li>
    <li>My website redirects to https when using http.</li>
    <li>It uses HTTPS on port 443.</li>
    <li>My website redirects viewers to port 443.</li>
    <li>I worked on the porject incrementally throughout the week doing some work each day.</li>
    <li>Here is the report!</li>
